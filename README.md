# maipatana_flask_blog

This is the code of my website that I am working on.<br>
The are three major parts; blogs, tutorials and projects.<br>
I am migrating from WordPress (maipatana.me) to flask.<br>
Hopefully I can launch this blog within this year.<br>

The site is ready to be used.<br>
The rest is to add more contents in /content/blogs/ folder.<br>
Category of the post is determinded by cats tag.<br>
There are three categories at the moment: blogs, tutorials and projects.<br>

I have done the skeleton of the website.<br>
Tutorials and projects aren't yet concluded how it's going to be.<br>
I will soon start transfer my contents from my old site to here.
Also will work on home-page as well.
